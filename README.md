# EmployeeDataAnalysis-EDA

Employee Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about employees, including their team, position, age, salary, and height. The analysis includes preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset is stored in a CSV file (myexcel - myexcel.csv.csv) and contains the following columns:

Team: The team to which the employee belongs.
Position: The position of the employee.
Age: The age of the employee.
Salary: The salary of the employee.
Preprocessing Steps
Reading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Adding a new column 'height' with random values between 150 and 180.
Checking for missing values and dropping rows with missing values if any are found.
Analysis Tasks
Team Distribution: Analyzing the distribution of employees across teams.
Position Distribution: Analyzing the distribution of employees across positions.
Age Group Distribution: Categorizing employees into age groups and analyzing the distribution.
Team and Position Salary Expenditure: Analyzing the total salary expenditure of each team and position.
Correlation between Age and Salary: Calculating the correlation coefficient between age and salary.
Insights Gained
The distribution of employees across teams and positions.
The most common age group and position.
The team and position with the highest total salary expenditure.
The correlation between age and salary.
Graphical Representations
Count plots and bar charts showing the distribution of employees across teams, positions, and age groups.
Scatter plot showing the relationship between age and salary.
Additional Information
The project includes visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance the analysis.
The insights gained from the analysis can help in making informed decisions related to team management, hiring, and salary adjustments.
